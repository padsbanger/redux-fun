## Having fun with Redux & React

Creating stores, reducers, subscribing & dispatching.

#### Running

In order to have JSX transfomer working, an http server is required:

`npm install -g http-server`

From then on just cd to the folder that has the files you want to serve and type

`http-server`

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8080/
